This is a project to prove that selenium can be used as a reliable way to get data from ammoseek website. The goal is 
to get the price per round offered by the various sellers for the most common 9mm rounds and identify the sellers that 
are offering the price lower or equal to the price per round threshold specified. 

If there are sellers idenfied who are offering a price lower than the threshold specified, then a SMS is sent to the
subscriber base. 

To do:
1. Use tinyurl for shortening the urls even more (saves SMS word count limit and data limits)
2. Add steps to add chrome browser
